<communic id="light1">You fell through the surface! Wow, that is some bad luck, maybe you hit some kind of sinkhole when you were surveying the surface. Your suit seems fine, signals look good and I can still access your camera. It's dark in there though, you should check your headlamp (press Enter or Return to read the next one)</communic>
<communic id="water1">Oh wait, there was a leak in your temperature regulation system! Stop moving! The suit is self-repairing, but you'll need to fill the system with water (H₂O) before you go forward, otherwise you'll heat up badly (Press Enter)</communic>
<communic id="waterdone1">Good! Now let's explore this place. Maps indicate that the cavern system you fell into has an exit not too far from your lander, so you should be able to get back quickly enough</communic>
<communic id="methane1">Some kind of ice is blocking that tunnel, you might be able to melt it with your methane (CH₄) torch (Press Enter)</communic>
<communic id="methanedone1">It does melt, great!</communic>
<communic id="acid1">This seems to be a bunch of metal debris, maybe from a previous survey? You got an acid-resistant hose with your synthesis tool, sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) could dissolve enough of it to let you pass (Press Enter)</communic>
<communic id="aciddone1">That did the trick, you'll be able to go through</communic>
<communic id="heat1">The temperature is climbing here, you can't go forward. Given a better refrigerant, like CTFE (C₂F₃Cl), your suit could deal with it</communic>
<communic id="heatdone1">We're pretty lucky you found that chlorine! You must be near the surface now</communic>
<communic id="ethanol1">Looks like your ethanol (C₂H₆O) fuel cell is empty, but I bet you can fill it up. Once you've done that, you'll be good to go! See you soon on the orbiter</communic>
<communic id="earthquake1">I think this was a tremor, you'll have to be quick or you'll get stuck!</communic>
<communic id="endcomm1">End</communic>
